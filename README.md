## 🗄️ Database Schema

The system uses a MySQL database with the following main entities:

### Core Tables

- **`user`** - Student/passenger accounts
- **`admin`** - Administrator accounts
- **`driver`** - Bus driver information
- **`route`** - Bus routes
- **`stop`** - Bus stop locations
- **`route_stops`** - Junction table linking routes to stops with order
- **`schedule`** - Bus schedules with departure/arrival times
- **`bus`** - Bus fleet information
- **`bus_location`** - GPS location tracking data
- **`user_favourite_route`** - User's favorite routes

### Key Relationships

- One route has many stops (via `route_stops`)
- One route has many schedules
- One schedule belongs to one route, one driver, and one admin
- One bus follows one route and one schedule
- One bus has many location records
- Many users can favorite many routes (many-to-many)

See the ER diagram above for complete relationship details.
